# Your-Health-Project

Your Health is a web-based application built using MERN stack that can be used to keep an online health journal. A database will be used to store information that will be entered by the user. This will record the date, time, and an entry the user wishes to log. Utilising this software will ensure users are able to stick to medical regimes and have access to all their essential medical information, hopefully allowing them to maintain and improve their health. 

This software is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and utilises the MERN stack development library. The web-based interface will provide users with a simple and effective method of viewing and updating their data through HTML forms designed in react and styled with Bootstrap.
